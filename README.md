## Whats your inspiration?
Wordie is my take on Wordle, created by Josh Wardle (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).

## Why did you make this?
Self learning! This is my attempt at using Tailwind for the first time in a personal project as well as Vue.js 3.0. 

## Are the wordies the same for each user?
Yes, just like Wordle, the wordies will be the same for everyone who visits. This is driven by the total amount of days that have progressed so far since the creation of Wordie (1st Feb 2022). No spoilers!

## Does it track my stats across multiple attempts?
Yes, it does (or it will do if it's not in there yet). Your stats will be carried across with localStorage, so don't change device or clear your cache!
